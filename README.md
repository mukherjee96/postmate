## What is PostMate trying to solve?
As part of the activities of running [GeekyMinds](https://geekyminds.co.in), my tech blog, we post some or the other content everyday on various social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest, etc. The format of our posts differ from content to content, platform to platform. 

For example, our Revisit C++ series requires a particular set of hashtags related to C++ and a particular header text (for example, #RevisitCPP Day 15) that's part of every post. On the other hand, a regular post where I'm sharing a link to an article from my blog will have a different header and set of tags.

This is just how parts of our content differ from each other. Now consider this: Instagram's post reach totally depends upon hashtags, while Facebook's doesn't at all. Therefore our post formats also have to differ across various social media platforms!

Remembering or keeping a physical note of so many types of formats is difficult. Posting daily on so many platforms with varying post formats is extremely tedious. üèãÔ∏è

## How does PostMate solve this?

PostMate enables you to create post templates. Each template can have a header and a footer. The Header can be used to set text that always goes at the top of your post. The Footer is ideal for setting text that goes at the end of your posts, like set of hashtags on Instagram.

Templates only hold the static or the repetitive parts of your posts. You can set the header or the footer or both, as you need.

## How does PostMate work?

You can create as many templates as you want and reuse them to generate your posts. All you have to do is type in the body of the post and click copy! That's all! üéâ

PostMate stores your templates on the cloud. This enables us to sync your templates to all devices you use PostMate on! Thanks to Reactive Programming, changes to your templates reflect almost instantly across all your synced devices.

You can swipe right on a template to edit/delete it. Tap on the template to open the post generation page.

## What is a Progressive Web App (PWA)?

PWAs are web applications which run on regular web browsers like Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. They set themselves apart from normal websites or web apps as can be installed on any device, just like a native app.

PostMate is a Progressive Web App and therefore runs in your web browser just like a website and you can install it on your laptop/smartphone if you feel like!

I decided to go with the PWA technology instead of targeting native platforms like Android or iOS because, as mentioned above, PWAs can be deployed to a wide number of computing platforms without requiring the source code to be rewritten for every platform.
